0.6 31-Mar-2016
    * Fix setup.rb, which still refered to Ruby pre-1.9.1's Config
      module (nowadays, RbConfig)
    * Rework ClipItem#read_kind_place_tstamp due to format changes
      in newer Kindle models

0.5 01-Jan-2014
    * By user request, add a column specifying "location".

      What we get as a location can be either Kindle-location or page
      (and sometimes even a string with both!), determined by the
      device — I have not found a case where a single book is
      presented in an inconsistent fashion.

0.4 18-Jan-2013
    * UTF-8 invalid files led to a crash during startup - Ignore
      malformed characters.

0.3 9-Aug-2011
    * Update from deprecated libglade2 to Gtk::Builder
    * Added a manpage

0.2 14-Jun-2011
    * First public, versioned release!
    * Added an "about" window with my information. Ego trip, yay!
    * The "open" button works — It even reports errors
    * Moved source layout to use Minero Aoki's setup.rb
